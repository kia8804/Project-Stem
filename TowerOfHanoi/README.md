In the Tower of Hanoi, there are three pegs: **A**, **B** and **C**. On peg **A**, there are a number of discs, 1 to n, 1 being the smallest and n being the biggest. The discs are impaled on peg **A** in decreasing order of size from bottom to top—disc n, the largest, is at the bottom through to disc 1, the smallest, at the top. The objective is to move all n discs from peg **A** to peg **C** (using, if required, the “temporary peg”, peg **B**) subject to the following constraints:

- only one disc, the top disc on any peg, can be moved at a time;
- a larger disc cannot be placed on top of a smaller disc.
