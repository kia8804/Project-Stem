Create a program that reads a 15 x 15 grid, which represents human cells. The cells are depicted with a plus sign “+” if they are healthy cells, and a minus sign “-” if they are cancerous. The outside rows and columns of the grid will contain only plus signs “+”.
This is a graphic of a cigarette with smoke coming from the end of it. 
The program will find the number of blobs of cancerous cells in the grid.

Note: Use the Flood Fill algorithm to determine this information.

Your application could look as follows:
